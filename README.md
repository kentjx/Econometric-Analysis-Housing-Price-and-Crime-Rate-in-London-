From our estimation, we can tell that every 1% increase in violent crimes decreases the housing price by 0.0312% on average approximately.
The magnitude is more than twice detrimental as compared to all crimes and property crimes. This would mean that people are willing to pay more to avoid violent crimes in their neighbourhood.

We added in the interaction term as we suspected there is a discrepancy between how crimes rates affect freehold and leasehold properties. The coefficient of the interaction term refers to the house price difference between leasehold and freehold at a certain level of crime rates. For example, 1% increase in violent crime rate affects freehold property at a higher magnitude of 0.0116% as compared to that of leasehold properties on average, approximately. This shows that people are more willing to pay to avoid violent crimes when their property value is higher.
